## _Note_
You can customize the weights to each of the metrics! Just open `age_weights.json` and/or `complexity_weights.json` files to configure weights given to each metric. Also, there is an in-built settings option in the extension itself. Adjust the values based on your preference, or leave it be! By doing this, users can define 'LEGACY' according to their own needs!
